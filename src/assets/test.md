How about some [online resources](http://www.google.com "Google")

<!-- The text in double quotes after the URL is the title of the link -->
Another [resource](http://www.wikipedia.org)


<!-- The following is an automatic link -->
<http://www.google.com>
<!-- Images -->
<!-- Also. Images must be in same repo.
Or you might have to implement something like downloading online images using link -->
![Image of a tree](./tree.jpg "Tree is a thing")
